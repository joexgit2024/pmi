Dear Jauhar Janjua,

Thank you for your registration and interest in PMI Sydney Chapter's Project Management Day of Service (PMDoS) 2025. We want to update you on the outcome of our selection process.

SELECTION OUTCOME UPDATE

After careful consideration of all responses, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for PMDoS 2025. This decision was extremely difficult given the exceptional quality of applications we received.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
📊 We received an overwhelming response to PMDoS 2025
🎯 Limited project capacity required us to make very selective choices
⚖️ The selection process was highly competitive and based on specific charity project requirements
✨ Your application demonstrated strong professional capabilities

REASONS FOR HIGH COMPETITION:
- Record number of registrations (33+ PMPs for limited positions)
- Specific skill matching requirements from charity partners
- Project complexity and scope considerations
- Team composition and experience balance needs

THIS IS NOT A REFLECTION OF YOUR CAPABILITIES:
❌ This outcome does not reflect the quality of your professional skills
❌ This is not an assessment of your value as a project management professional
❌ This decision was based on specific project matching requirements, not overall merit
