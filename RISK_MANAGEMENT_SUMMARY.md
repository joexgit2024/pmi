# Risk Management in PMP-Charity Matching System

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Problem Addressed
The user identified a critical risk: **"each project needs at least two people, as if only assigning one we have risk"**

### Solution Implemented
Updated the flexible assignment algorithm to enforce a **minimum of 2 PMPs per project** for risk management.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Changes
1. **Phase 1: Minimum Assignment**
   - Ensures every project gets exactly 2 PMPs first (risk mitigation)
   - Uses best-match scoring for these critical assignments

2. **Phase 2: Capacity-Based Additional Assignments**
   - Assigns remaining PMPs based on project capacity scoring
   - High-priority/complex projects can receive 3+ PMPs

### Capacity Calculation
```
Project Capacity = max(calculated_capacity, 2)
```
- **Minimum**: Always 2 PMPs (risk management)
- **Maximum**: Based on priority, complexity, and skill requirements

## üìä Results Summary

### Current Assignment (22 PMPs, 10 Projects)
- **All projects**: Minimum 2 PMPs ‚úÖ
- **High-capacity projects**: 3 PMPs where beneficial
- **Total coverage**: 100% of available PMPs (22/22)

### Team Distribution
- 8 projects: Exactly 2 PMPs (minimum safe staffing)
- 2 projects: 3 PMPs (additional capacity for complex projects)

## ‚ö° Usage

### Standard Mode (20 PMPs, 2 per project)
```bash
python run_complete_analysis.py
```

### Flexible Mode (All 22 PMPs, min 2 per project)
```bash
python run_complete_analysis.py --flexible
```

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Risk Mitigation**: No single points of failure
2. **Project Continuity**: Always 2+ people familiar with each project
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Multiple perspectives on each project
4. **Resource Optimization**: All available PMPs utilized effectively
5. **Scalability**: Algorithm adapts to different PMP/project ratios

## üîç Verification

The system logs show clear evidence of risk management:
```
=== PHASE 1: Ensuring minimum 2 PMPs per project ===
  Assigned [PMP1] to [Project] (min requirement)
  Assigned [PMP2] to [Project] (min requirement)
```

Every project now has redundancy and reduced operational risk.
